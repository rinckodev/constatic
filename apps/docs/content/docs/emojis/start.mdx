# Introduction

The CLI emoji tool is used to manage emojis for a discord bot application in an easier way than using the discord portal.

With this tool you can:
- 📂 Upload images from a directory and subfolders to create emojis for the application
- 📋 List all existing emojis
- 🔄 Update emojis easily
- 🗑️ Delete selected emojis or all emojis at once
- 📝 Generate a json file with all emoji names and ids to easily use in your project

# Getting started

To use this feature, start by running the CLI:

<CliCommand packageName="constatic@latest" />

Then in the main menu select the option `Manage discord emojis`.

<CliMenus.Main lang="en" selected="emojis"/>

Before accessing the emoji menu, you need to select an application. You can do this a few ways:

- Selecting a saved application in the [token presets](/docs/presets/tokens) menu
- Selecting the token in one of the .env files detected in the root from where the CLI was executed.
- Inserting the token manually through the `New temporary application` option

After that, you will see the menu with all the options to manage your application's emojis. Check out how to use each option:
