# Emoji file

With the `Generate emoji file` option you can obtain a json file with all the names and IDs of your application's emojis so that you can use them in the texts and components of your bot project through utility functions.

You can enter the name and path of the file (by default it will be `emojis.json`). But you can choose another name for the file such as `emojis.dev.json` or even pass the path to a folder `./assets/emojis.json`.

Next, you can choose how the emojis will be listed in the file
- IDs - The values of all properties are just the IDs of the emojis
- URLs - The values of all properties are the CDN URLs of the emojis
