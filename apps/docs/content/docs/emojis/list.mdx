# Emoji list

You can list all the emojis in the application with the `List` option. You will see a list in the terminal with the emoji type (whether it is animated or static), name and id. This way you can check the existing emojis before doing any other operation such as `Send`, `Update` or `Delete` emojis.

    The example below illustrates how emojis will be displayed in the terminal (Fictitious Names and IDs).
