# Applying Script Presets

You can apply existing presets to an already created project using this option.

After [accessing the script presets menu](/docs/presets/scripts/start), you can select the **apply** option:

<CliMenus.Scripts lang="en" selected="apply" />

You’ll be able to select as many presets as you want, and the files will be copied to the directory where the CLI is being executed, following [the same structure used during creation](/docs/presets/scripts/new).
