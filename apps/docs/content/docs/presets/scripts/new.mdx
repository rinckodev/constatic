# Creating a New Script Preset

<Callout type="warn">
    It's recommended to run the CLI from the root of a project that already contains the files structured the way you want them to be in the preset.
</Callout>

After [accessing the script presets menu](/docs/presets/scripts/start), you can select the option to create a new preset:

<CliMenus.Scripts lang="en" selected="new" />

## Add Files

You can add files to your preset by selecting the `Add files` option:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["files"]} hidden={["rm", "uninstall"]} />

<Callout type="warn">
    All files starting from the directory where the CLI was executed will be displayed
</Callout>

In the menu that appears with the files, you can search for a specific file by simply typing. To select/deselect a file, press the `Tab` key and confirm with the `Enter` key.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Understand how files are stored" id="overwrite">
    Let's say you run the CLI at the root of a project like this:
    ```md
    src/
    ├── discord/ ...
    ├── functions/
    │   └── utils/
    │       ├── emojis.ts
    │       └── res.ts
    ├── tools/
    │   └── canvas/
    │       └── card.ts
    ├── env.ts
    └── index.ts
    ```

    You’ll be able to select any file in this directory and its subfolders.  
    Once selected, the files will be stored in the CLI’s config folder with the same structure they were selected in.  
    So if you select these two files:
    | | |
    | -- | ---- |
    | `res.ts` | `src/functions/utils/res.ts` |
    | `card.ts` | `src/tools/canvas/card.ts` |

    They will be stored like this:
    ```md
    src/
    ├── functions/
    │   └── utils/
    │       └── res.ts
    └── tools/
         └── canvas/
             └── card.ts
    ```

    When this preset is later applied, the files will be copied in the same structure, starting from the directory where the CLI is being executed.
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Remove Files

If you’ve already added files to the preset, the `Remove files` option will appear. You can use it to select which files to remove:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["rm"]} hidden={["uninstall"]} />

If you change your mind about a file, you can select it for removal.

## Add Dependencies

If the files you've selected require dependencies, you can add them using the `Add dependencies` option:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["deps"]} hidden={["uninstall"]} />

You’ll be able to type the name of a dependency to add it to the preset.

<Callout type="info">
    You can add a dependency with a specific version using the same syntax as npm:
    Using the Fastify library as an example:
    - Install a major version: `fastify@5`
    - Install a minor version: `fastify@4.28`
    - Install a specific version: `fastify@3.25.2`
</Callout>

Then, you can choose whether to add it as a production or development dependency:

| Dependency Type | Property in package.json |
| -- | ---- |
| Production dependency | `dependencies` |
| Development dependency | `devDependencies` |

## Remove Dependencies

You can remove previously added dependencies using the `Remove dependencies` option:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["uninstall"]} />

## Preview

You can preview the structure of your script preset using the `Preview` option:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["preview"]} />

The terminal will display the file and dependency structure of the preset.

## Save

Once you’ve finished building your script preset, save it using the `Save` option:

<CliMenus.ModifyScript lang="en" selected={["save"]} />

You’ll be asked to enter a name for the preset. Choose a short and clear name that helps identify its contents (you can use emojis if you'd like).
