PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online.

To get started, install pm2 globally:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
```
Create a file in the project root to run the `start` script. Name it `pm2.start.mjs`:
```js title="pm2.start.mjs"
import { exec } from "node:child_process";
exec("npm run start", { windowsHide: true });
```
<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Make sure the project is built">
    In order to run it, your project must first be built using the command below:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Then you can start your application using this command:
```bash
pm2 start --name my-bot ./pm2.start.mjs
```

<Callout type="info">
    You can set a custom name for your process using the `--name` flag
</Callout>

Done, your application will run in the background on the machine.

Below are some useful commands you can use to manage your process:
| Comando | Uso | Descrição |
| -       |  -   |    -      |
| list |`pm2 list` | Displays all registered processes |
| stop    | `pm2 stop my-bot` | Stop your application process |
| restart |`pm2 restart my-bot` | Restart your application process |
| logs |`pm2 logs my-bot` | Displays your application's process logs |
