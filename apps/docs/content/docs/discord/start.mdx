## Generating the project

To start a new discord bot project you can use the CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a new folder for your project and open it on your terminal
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Use the command below to start CLI
  <CliCommand packageName="constatic@latest" />
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the first option: `Init discord bot project`
  </Step>
  <Step>
  You will be asked a few questions to prepare your project:
  ```md
  - Project name (path to folder)
  - Database (optional)
  - Extra resources (optional)
  - Install dependencies (optional)
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once you have answered everything, your project will be generated and you can start developing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup the project

With the project generated, place your bot token in the `.env` file that is at the project root.
<Callout type="info">
    [See how to create a bot application and get token on the discord developer portal](/discord/guides/application)
</Callout>

```properties title=".env"
BOT_TOKEN=yourtoken
```

After placing the token you can execute the project in development mode using the command below:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After that your bot should be online and you can start development!
