An API (Application Programming Interface) server is a system that exposes data and functionality of an application through endpoints accessible through HTTP requests, allowing different systems, such as web, mobile, or third-party applications, to communicate and use these resources securely and efficiently.

Using the [CLI to generate your project](/docs/discord/start), you can select a server API preset.

<CliMenus.Servers lang="pt" />

The preset API server will be in the `server` folder inside `src`.

The available presets are:
