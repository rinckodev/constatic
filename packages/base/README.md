# Constatic Base

Library with structures and functions for creating modern Discord applications.

It all starts with the bootstrap function.

```ts
import { bootstrap } from "@constatic/base";

await bootstrap({ meta: import.meta });
```

⚠️ It is recommended to use the [Constant CLI](https://constatic-docs.vercel.app/pt/docs/discord/start) to generate a project instead of doing it manually.
